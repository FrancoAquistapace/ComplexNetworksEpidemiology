# Individual identity for disease metapopulations in scale-free networks
Final project for the Physics of Life, Data and Epidemiology course of the Master's Degree in Physics of Data, at University of Padova. The aim of this project is to explore the effect of different mobility models for disease metapopulations under commuter dynamics in scale-free networks. 

The project consists of the following:
- **simulations.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook with the Python code developed in order to run the different mobility models on arbitrary networks, as well as the code to generate scale-free population networks. The Gillespie algorithm is used to perform the epidemic simulations.
- **data:** Folder containing the results from every simulation, as well as the generated scale-free networks.
- **analysis.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook with the analysis of the scale-free networks and simulation outputs, also performed with Python. 
- **figures:** Folder with the figures generated during the analysis of the results.
- **presentation.key:** Presentation of the project in keynote format.
- **scale_free_session.cys:** Session file for the Cytoscape software, used to generate images of the scale-free networks developed in the project.
